This token is constructed to be dynamic with its hyper-deflationary function. This supports the tokens consistant growth into the future and each transaction has a 10% fee which is evenly distributed. With each transaction an amount of BNB is collected and used for planting trees with the foundation OneTreePlanted, allowing for carbon neutral transactions. This creates a powerful cryptocurrency, ready for adoption by businesses not willing to use energy heavy alternatives. More features will be revealed with future developments.
